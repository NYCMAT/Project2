## LOG
After settling on a plan for framework and app idea. My goal was to make sure I am comfortable deploying to heroku. The project took alot longer as I was making sure the app runs locally on nodemon as well as when pushed to heroku. Since project ask for portfolio quality styling, i did exactly that and used a similar layout as my portfolio project.  Made sure MVP was achieved using 7 routes.
CSS and styling is still not where I want it to be. I also practice with bootstrap on a few pages. 
Had issues implrementing the Pokemon TCG API, decided to leave it out.
